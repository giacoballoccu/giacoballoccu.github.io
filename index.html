                <p>
                  I interned two times as Applied Scientist at <a href="https://www.amazon.science/">Amazon</a> in Edinburgh, where I worked on <a href="https://advertising.amazon.com/library/news/modeled-amazon-audiences">Contextual Targeting</a> and Recommendation for Online Advertisment.
                  I did my PhD at <a href="https://en.unica.it/en">University of Cagliari</a>, where I was advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1unjC10AAAAJ&hl=en">Ludovico Boratto</a>, Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JZhqKBIAAAAJ&hl=it">Mirko Marras</a>, under the group of Prof. <a href="https://web.unica.it/unica/it/ateneo_s07_ss01.page?contentId=SHD30371">Gianni Fenu</a>.

                  I'm interested in recommender systems, deep learning, learning representations and generative AI. Most of my PhD research was about creating methodologies for generating explainable paths in knowledge aware recommender systems including the use of Reinforcemnt Learning and Trasformer based methodologies. During my internships I mostly worked with LLM for representation learning and recommendation.

           <p>
Supporting and developing the Sardinian ecosystem has always been central to my personal mission. Born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuxis">Nuxis</a>, a small village, I navigated my path largely independently, driven by a natural curiosity and determination. However, I believe in fostering change by reducing friction and raising awareness to improve life satisfaction and unlock talent. Too often, potential goes untapped due to the limited opportunities in under-resourced areas like mine.  </p>
          <p>
Over the years, I have actively pursued this mission by serving as a Teaching Assistant for Algorithms and Data Structures at <a href="https://web.unica.it/unica/en/crs_60_79.page">Applied Computer Science and Data Analytics (Unica)</a> for the past three years, teaching at the <a href="https://www.puntocartesiano.it//progetti/ri-creazione/campus/campus-attuali-e-futuri/una-settimana-da-robot/">Pula Summer School (2023/2024)</a>, providing <a href="https://giacoballoccu.github.io/supervision_and_mentorship">individual mentorship</a>, and organizing <a href="https://giacoballoccu.github.io/bbt">Breaking Barriers in Tech Sardinia (BBT)</a> a program of multiple events that does dissemination on scientific research and careers in tech. This year, I plan to reinvent BBT Sardinia and continue supporting mentees through dedicated mentorship and supervision.\n
