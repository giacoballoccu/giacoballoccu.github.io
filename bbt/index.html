            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Breaking Barriers in Tech Sardinia (BBT) aims to distill knowledge on university and career topics, extending to personal development. This initiative began during my first year of Ph.D. with my students of Algorithms and Data Structures, with the goal of sharing insights I wish I had known at the start of my Computer Science journey. Our mission is summarized by three main pillars:
            </p>
            
            <h3>Awareness</h3>
            <p>
                Having clarity about our objectives or the problems we want to solve helps us work backward to achieve them. In computer science, we don’t start by coding but by understanding the problem, exploring solutions, and then approaching it. This blog exposes readers to diverse stories and experiences to broaden perspectives, following Socrates’ ideal of the examined life.
            </p>

            <h3>Hope</h3>
            <p>
                Our generation faces unique challenges, from global warming to rapid technological growth. Through stories of resilience and achievement, BBT aims to inspire hope and a positive outlook. As Einstein said, \"The important thing is not to stop questioning.\"
            </p>

            <h3>Resources</h3>
            <p>
                Our knowledge is shaped by what we consume. High-quality resources, especially those in English, offer significant growth potential. This blog will gather and translate resources, fostering a supportive community and creating events to facilitate shared learning.
