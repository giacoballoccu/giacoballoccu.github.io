        <section id="mission">
            <p>
Breaking Barriers in Tech (BBT) is dedicated to distilling essential knowledge about university paths, career opportunities, and personal development. This initiative began in my first year of Ph.D., working with students in Algorithms and Data Structures, with the goal of sharing insights I wish I’d had when starting my own journey in Computer Science. BBT seeks to inspire and encourage students to take proactive steps in shaping their futures. Our mission is anchored by three core pillars: </p>
            
            <h4>Awareness</h4>
            <p>
                Having clarity about our objectives or the problems we want to solve helps us work backward to achieve them. This concept is fundamental in computer science; you don’t start by coding a solution but by understanding the problem, considering potential solutions, and then approaching it systematically. This framework, effective in problem-solving, can easily be applied to personal or career goals. Often, the main blocker is a lack of clarity about what we want to experiment with or achieve. We are frequently unaware of what we can do. In today’s world, with sufficient circumstances and cognitive shortcuts, we tend to focus only on a narrow set of choices. While this is essential for our biological processing, it may also limit our thinking, leading us to see only paths walked by others. A natural counter is exposure to diverse stories and experiences, helping us understand what exists and what we like or dislike. 
            </p>

            <h4>Hope</h4>
            <p>
If we do not see anything positive ahead, why would we bother striving? Although our generation has mostly lived through years of peace, we face unprecedented challenges in envisioning a positive future. We are tasked with tackling issues the world has never encountered before: global warming, strong globalization, migratory fluxes, and technology growing at a pace that outstrips society's capacity to adapt. It is not easy to envision the future, especially when we are constantly bombarded by negative news, both in the media and on social networks. This environment makes it easy to feel paralyzed or dependent on constant updates that may not even matter. I believe that impact is achieved through action. This blog aims to tell my story and the stories of those who, like me, have emerged from Sardinia, other small realities, or Italy to find a space for expression and human potential. For us, “achievement” refers to realizing one’s potential rather than fame or monetary success.
            </p>

            <h4>Resources</h4>
            <p>
<p>A key factor in defining who we are is what we consume and think about. German philosophers emphasize that language is an extension of thought; possessing a strong vocabulary enables us to express concepts, ideas, and emotions more effectively. Language can also serve as a barrier to accessing materials. In general, highly specialized individuals share their knowledge online primarily in English, and top universities and educational resources are often English-based. Limitation to the Italian language significantly slows access to resources, limits learning potential, and imposes a nearly insurmountable barrier. This blog will gather high-quality resources from around the world and provide translations where possible to democratize access. Furthermore, we are strongly influenced by our environment—family, community, society, and the people around us. This blog will encourage the formation of local communities with similar passions and promote events.</p>
            </p>
            
        <p>
        To achieve this mission, we are committed to creating a wealth of accessible content, including curated resources and blog posts on technical topics, guidance on job roles and industry insights, and sharing personal stories of Italian students who have found success—detailing the challenges they faced and the strategies they used to overcome them. We will also provide organized tables of resources, offering students a practical toolkit to help navigate their academic and professional paths.
